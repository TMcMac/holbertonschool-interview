# Holberton Algorithm Challenges and Interview Prep

This series of challenges is meant to help work through problems of algorithmic thinking and common interview whiteboarding / live coding questions. These will cover a wide array of challenges such as binary trees, sorting algorithms, apis, among others. Each directory in this repo is a stand alone project realted to a concept or common interview question. I (Tim), have had a lot of fun working through these challenges myself as each is a bit different and offers plenty or frustrations and learning along the way!

## Projects:gear:

* 0x00-lockboxes - You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

* 0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list - Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

* 0x02-heap_insert - Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* 0x03-minimum_operations - In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

* 0x05-linked_list_palindrome - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

* 0x06-log_parsing - Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.

* 0x07-linked_list_cycle - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

* 0x08-palindrome_integer - Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

* 0x09-utf8_validation - Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

* 0x0B-menger - Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge

* 0x0C-nqueens - The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

* 0x0D-sorted_array_to_avl - Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array

* 0x0F-starwars_api - Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:

* 0x10-rain - Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

* 0x11-heap_sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* 0x13-count_it - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

* 0x15-infinite_multiplication - Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:

* 0x17-find_the_loop - Calssic tortous and hare problem to find a loop in an singly linked list

* 0x18-merge_sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
