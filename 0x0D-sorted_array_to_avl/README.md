## Tasks
### 0. AVL - From sorted array

Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array

* Prototype: avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted
* And size is the number of element in the array
* Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or NULL on failure
* You can assume there will be no duplicate value in the array
* You are not allowed to rotate
